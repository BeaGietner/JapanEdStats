The data covers all 47 prefectures of Japan, plus a national average, a
mean 平均値 and its standard deviation 標準偏差.

\hypertarget{sections-overview}{%
\section{Sections Overview}\label{sections-overview}}

The dataset is an unbalanced panel, with data points starting in 2005,
jumping to 2010, and then continuing from 2012 to 2022 for most
variables. Each sheet in the original Excel file represents a different
educational statistic, including:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Educational institutions 教育施設
\item
  Teachers 教員
\item
  Pupils 生徒
\item
  Junior colleges, colleges, and universities 短期大学・大学
\item
  Specialty schools and miscellaneous schools 専修学校・各種学
\item
  Educational diffusion rates 教育普及度
\item
  Education expenditure per pupil 1人当たりの学校等教育費
\end{enumerate}

Each variable is represented in a sheet according to the order above.
They contains the name in both in English and Japanese.

The data for each statistic is presented in a long format, with all
variables as rows. The dataset includes 47 prefectures plus a row for
the national average 全国.

Note: The actual number of variables and observations may differ from
the placeholder values in this documentation. Users should check the
loaded data for the most accurate information.

For each section, it is provided: a) a list of variables,\\
b) the years covered,\\
c) the calculation methods, and~ d) an interpretation of what the
metrics mean and their significance.

\subsection{Section 1: Education 教育, Educational institutions
教育施設:}\label{section-1-education-ux6559ux80b2-educational-institutions-ux6559ux80b2ux65bdux8a2d}}

The variables covered in this section are:

1.1 Elementary schools (per 100,000 population 6-11 years)\\
1.2 Junior high schools (per 100,000 population 12-14 years)\\
1.3 Senior high schools (per 100,000 population 15-17 years)\\
1.4 Kindergartens (per 100,000 population 3-5 years)\\
1.5 Day nurseries (per 100,000 population 0-5 years)\\
1.6 Authorized child centers (per 100,000 population 0-5 years)

2.1 Elementary schools (per inhabitable area 100 k㎡)\\
2.2 Junior high schools (per inhabitable area 100 k㎡) pre-2019 / Number
of lower secondary schools (per inhabitable area 100 k㎡) from 2019
onwards\\
2.3 Senior high schools (per inhabitable area 100 k㎡) pre-2019 / Number
of upper secondary schools (per inhabitable area 100 k㎡) from 2019
onwards

3.1 Ratio/percentage of public senior high/upper secondary schools\\
3.2 Ratio/percentage of public kindergartens\\
3.3 Ratio/percentage of public day nurseries

\hypertarget{subsections-1.1---1.6}{%
\subsubsection{Subsections 1.1 - 1.6:}\label{subsections-1.1---1.6}}

The data is separated in columns per 100,000 population by different age
ranges:\\
Elementary schools 小学校数: 6-11\\
Junior high schools 中学校数: 12-14\\
Senior high schools 高等学校数: 15-17\\
Kindergartens 幼稚園数: 0-3\\

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The years covered are: 2005, 2010, 2012-2020
\end{itemize}

Day nurseries 保育所数: 3-5\\

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The years covered are: 2005, 2010-2018, 2020
\item
  The calculations are made by employment the formula: (Number of
  ``variable'' / Population aged ``variable''``) * 100,000
\item
  For example, if we take data for Kanagawa 神奈川県 in 2012 we have
  184.9, it was calculated by (Number of elementary schools in Kanagawa
  / Population of 6-11 year olds in Kanagawa) * 100,000 = 184.9. This
  method allows for comparison between prefectures with different
  population sizes.
\end{itemize}

One variable that was introduced later in the dataset was: Authorized
child centers (per 100,000 population 0-5 years)
認定こども園数(０～５歳人口10万人当たり)\\

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The years covered are 2015, 2018-2022
\item
  The calculations are made by employing the formula: (Number of
  authorized child centers / Population aged 0-5 years) * 100,000
\item
  For each prefecture and year, they would have: counted the number of
  authorized child centers, counted the total population aged 0-5 years,
  divided the number of centers by the population, then multiplied the
  result by 100,000 to get the ratio per 100,000 children.
\item
  This metric provides insights into the availability of authorized
  child centers across different regions of Japan relative to the young
  child population. It can reflect various factors such as local
  childcare policies, demographic trends, and societal needs in
  different areas. The data over time allows for analysis of trends in
  the expansion of authorized child centers. These figures can be
  important indicators of early childhood education and care provision,
  which may have implications for child development, work-life balance
  for parents, and broader social policies. Comparing the ratios between
  prefectures can reveal regional differences in childcare
  infrastructure and potentially inform resource allocation and policy
  decisions.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{subsections-2.1---2.3}{%
\subsubsection{Subsections 2.1 - 2.3}\label{subsections-2.1---2.3}}

They contain information on Junior high schools 中学校数-Lower secondary
schools and Senior high schools 高等学校数-Upper secondary schools per
inhabitable area 100 k㎡ 可住地面積100k㎡当たり.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The years covered are 2005, 2010, 2012-2022
\item
  The calculations are made by employment the formula: (Number of
  ``variable schools'' / Inhabitable area in k㎡) * 100
\item
  For each prefecture and year, they would have: counted the total
  number of elementary schools, measured the total inhabitable area in
  square kilometers, divided the number of schools by the area, and then
  multiplied the result by 100 to get the number per 100 k㎡.
\item
  This measure shows how densely or sparsely schools are distributed
  across the habitable land in each prefecture, which can be
  particularly relevant in a country like Japan with varying population
  densities and significant uninhabitable areas (like mountains).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{subsections-3.1---3.3}{%
\subsubsection{Subsections 3.1 - 3.3:}\label{subsections-3.1---3.3}}

They contain information on the Ratio/percentage of public senior
high/upper secondary schools 公立高等学校割合 (\%), Ratio/percentage of
public kindergartens 公立幼稚園割合 (\%), and Ratio/percentage of public
day nurseries/nurse centers 公営保育所割合 (\%) for the years 2005,
2010, 2012-2022 (except for the last one, Ratio/percentage of public day
nurseries/nurse centers, for which we have data for the years 2005,
2010-2018, 2020).

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The calculations are made by employment the formula: (Number of public
  ``variable schools'' / Total number of ``variable schools'') * 100
\item
  For each prefecture and year, they would have: counted the number of
  public schools, counted the total number schools, divided the number
  of public schools by the total number, then multiplied the result by
  100 to get the percentage. For example, the national average 全国 for
  2012 is 73.4\%, which means that in 2012, 73.4\% of all senior high
  schools in Japan were public schools. It was named ``ratio'' until
  2020, when the variable was changed to ``percentage'', but they were
  calculated the same way.
\item
  These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive view of the
  educational infrastructure across Japan. The number of institutions
  per population gives insight into the accessibility of education for
  different age groups, while the number per inhabitable area reflects
  the physical distribution of schools. The ratios/percentages of public
  institutions show the balance between public and private education
  provision. Together, these metrics can reveal regional differences in
  educational resources, urbanization patterns, and government
  priorities in education. They allow for comparisons between
  prefectures with different population sizes and geographical
  characteristics. Analyzing these metrics over time (2005, 2010,
  2012/2011) can also indicate trends in educational policy and
  infrastructure development across Japan, such as changes in school
  distribution or shifts in the balance between public and private
  education. This information is important for understanding the
  educational landscape and informing policy decisions related to
  educational access and resource allocation.

\item
  The calculations are made by employment the formula: (Number of female
  ``variable school'' teachers / Total number of ``variable school''
  school teachers) * 100
\item
  For each prefecture and year, they would have: counted the number of
  female ``variable school'' teachers, counted the total number of
  ``variable school'' teachers, divided the number of female teachers by
  the total number, then multiplied the result by 100 to get the
  percentage.
\item
  These metrics provide insights into the gender balance among school
  teachers across different regions of Japan. They can reflect various
  factors such as societal norms, employment policies, and career
  preferences in different areas. Comparing the ratios between
  elementary and junior high/lower secondary school schools can reveal
  differences in gender distribution at different levels of education.
  The data over time allows for analysis of trends in gender
  representation in the teaching profession. These figures can be
  important indicators of gender equality in the education sector and
  may have implications for students' perceptions of gender roles in
  society.

  Japan, from early childhood through high school. The
  student-to-teacher and student-to-class ratios offer insights into the
  resources available to students and the potential quality of
  individual attention they might receive. The ratios of public
  institution attendance reflect the balance between public and private
  education in different regions, which can indicate both government
  priorities and societal preferences. Together, these metrics can
  reveal regional differences in educational resources, class sizes, and
  the structure of the education system. Comparing these metrics over
  time can also indicate trends in educational policy and practice
  across Japan, such as efforts to reduce class sizes or shifts in the

\begin{itemize}
\item
  These metrics provide insights into the financial investment in
  education across different levels of schooling and across different
  prefectures in Japan. They allow for comparisons of educational
  spending between different types of schools and between different
  regions. The data over time enables analysis of trends in educational
  funding, which could reflect changes in educational policies, economic
  conditions, or demographic shifts. Higher per-pupil expenditures might
  indicate greater resources available for education, potentially
  leading to better facilities, smaller class sizes, or more
  comprehensive educational programs. However, it's important to
  consider these figures alongside other metrics, such as educational
  outcomes and regional economic factors, for a more complete
  understanding of the education system's efficiency and effectiveness.
\item
  The inclusion of authorized child centers (Kindergarten-and-day-care
  center type) in this category reflects Japan's evolving early
  childhood education and care system, integrating traditional
  kindergartens with day-care services. This allows for analysis of
  resource allocation in these integrated facilities compared to
  traditional kindergartens and other school types.
\item
  When interpreting these statistics, researchers and policymakers
  should be aware of potential differences in cost structures between
  urban and rural areas, variations in local funding models, and any
  changes in the definition or scope of educational expenses over time.
  Cross-referencing these expenditure figures with other educational and
  demographic data can provide a more comprehensive picture of the
  educational landscape across Japan.
