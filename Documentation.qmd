- Junior High Schools (中学校): Compulsory education for ages 12-15 (3 years)
- Senior High Schools (高等学校): Optional education for ages 15-18 (3 years)

## Early Childhood Education
- Kindergartens (幼稚園): Educational institutions for children ages 3-5
- Day Nurseries (保育所): Childcare facilities for children ages 0-5, primarily for working parents
- Authorized Child Centers (認定こども園): Integrated centers offering both kindergarten education and daycare services

## Higher Education
- Junior Colleges (短期大学): 2-year institutions offering associate degrees
- Universities (大学): 4-year institutions offering bachelor's degrees and graduate programs
- Graduate Schools (大学院): Advanced degree programs (Master's and Doctoral)

## Specialized Education
- Specialized Training Colleges (専修学校): Vocational schools offering practical skills and qualifications
- Miscellaneous Schools (各種学校): Schools that don't fit other categories, including international schools, language schools, and preparatory schools

## Other Types
- Special Needs Schools (特別支援学校): Schools for students with special educational needs
- Secondary Education Schools (中等教育学校): Combined junior and senior high schools (6 years)
- Technical Colleges (高等専門学校): 5-year technical education institutions starting after junior high school

# Important Notes About the Japanese Education System

## Administrative Structure
- Schools can be National (国立), Public (公立), or Private (私立)
- Public schools are primarily operated by local governments (prefectures and municipalities)
- The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT/文部科学省) oversees the entire system

## Compulsory Education
- Compulsory education (義務教育) covers 9 years: 6 years of elementary and 3 years of junior high school
- It is free at public schools
- Has an extremely high enrollment rate (near 100%)
- School year starts in April and ends in March

## School Transitions
- Almost all students progress from elementary to junior high school (99%+)
- High school enrollment rate is over 98%, though not compulsory
- University/college enrollment rate has been increasing, reaching about 80% in recent years

## Recent Trends and Changes
- Declining student populations due to demographic changes
- Increasing integration of kindergartens and day nurseries into authorized child centers
- Growing number of international programs and English-language education
- Introduction of new types of schools like compulsory education schools (義務教育学校) that combine elementary and junior high

## Regional Variations
- Urban areas typically have more private schools
- Rural areas face challenges with maintaining schools due to population decline
- Some regions have specific types of schools based on local needs (e.g., schools with dormitories in remote areas)

## Funding and Expenses
- Public schools are funded primarily through local and national government budgets
- Private schools receive some government subsidies but charge tuition
- Educational expenses can vary significantly between urban and rural areas

## Section 1: Education 教育, Educational institutions 教育施設:

The variables covered in this section are:

1.1 Elementary schools (per 100,000 population 6-11 years)\
1.2 Junior high schools (per 100,000 population 12-14 years)\
1.3 Senior high schools (per 100,000 population 15-17 years)\
1.4 Kindergartens (per 100,000 population 3-5 years)\
1.5 Day nurseries (per 100,000 population 0-5 years)\
1.6 Authorized child centers (per 100,000 population 0-5 years)

2.1 Elementary schools (per inhabitable area 100 k㎡)\
2.2 Junior high schools (per inhabitable area 100 k㎡) pre-2019 / Number of lower secondary schools (per inhabitable area 100 k㎡) from 2019 onwards\
2.3 Senior high schools (per inhabitable area 100 k㎡) pre-2019 / Number of upper secondary schools (per inhabitable area 100 k㎡) from 2019 onwards

3.1 Ratio/percentage of public senior high/upper secondary schools\
3.2 Ratio/percentage of public kindergartens\
3.3 Ratio/percentage of public day nurseries

### Subsections 1.1 - 1.6: 

The data is separated in columns per 100,000 population by different age ranges:\
Elementary schools 小学校数: 6-11\
Junior high schools 中学校数: 12-14\
Senior high schools 高等学校数: 15-17\
Kindergartens 幼稚園数: 0-3\

- The years covered are: 1995, 2000, 2005-2022

Day nurseries 保育所数: 3-5\

- The years covered are: 1995, 2000, 2004-2020

- The calculations are made by employing the formula: (Number of "variable" / Population aged "variable"") * 100,000

- For example, if we take data for Kanagawa 神奈川県 in 2012 we have 184.9, it was calculated by (Number of elementary schools in Kanagawa / Population of 6-11 year olds in Kanagawa) * 100,000 = 184.9. This method allows for comparison between prefectures with different population sizes.

One variable that was introduced later in the dataset was: Authorized child centers (per 100,000 population 0-5 years) 認定こども園数(０～５歳人口10万人当たり)\

- The years covered are 2015-2022

- The calculations are made by employing the formula: (Number of authorized child centers / Population aged 0-5 years) * 100,000

- For each prefecture and year, they would have: counted the number of authorized child centers, counted the total population aged 0-5 years, divided the number of centers by the population, then multiplied the result by 100,000 to get the ratio per 100,000 children.

- This metric provides insights into the availability of authorized child centers across different regions of Japan relative to the young child population. It can reflect various factors such as local childcare policies, demographic trends, and societal needs in different areas. The data over time allows for analysis of trends in the expansion of authorized child centers. These figures can be important indicators of early childhood education and care provision, which may have implications for child development, work-life balance for parents, and broader social policies. Comparing the ratios between prefectures can reveal regional differences in childcare infrastructure and potentially inform resource allocation and policy decisions.

### Subsections 2.1 - 2.3

They contain information on Junior high schools 中学校数-Lower secondary schools and Senior high schools 高等学校数-Upper secondary schools per inhabitable area 100 k㎡ 可住地面積100k㎡当たり.

- The years covered are 1995, 2000, 2005-2022

- The calculations are made by employing the formula: (Number of "variable schools" / Inhabitable area in k㎡) * 100

- For each prefecture and year, they would have: counted the total number of elementary schools, measured the total inhabitable area in square kilometers, divided the number of schools by the area, and then multiplied the result by 100 to get the number per 100 k㎡.

- This measure shows how densely or sparsely schools are distributed across the habitable land in each prefecture, which can be particularly relevant in a country like Japan with varying population densities and significant uninhabitable areas (like mountains).
 
### Subsections 3.1 - 3.3: 

They contain information on the Ratio/percentage of public senior high/upper secondary schools 公立高等学校割合 (%), Ratio/percentage of public kindergartens 公立幼稚園割合 (%), and Ratio/percentage of public day nurseries/nurse centers 公営保育所割合 (%) for the years 1995, 2000, 2005-2022 (except for the last one, Ratio/percentage of public day nurseries/nurse centers, for which we have data for the years 1995, 2000, 2004-2020).

- The calculations are made by employing the formula: (Number of public "variable schools" / Total number of "variable schools") * 100

- For each prefecture and year, they would have: counted the number of public schools, counted the total number schools, divided the number of public schools by the total number, then multiplied the result by 100 to get the percentage. For example, the national average 全国 for 2012 is 73.4%, which means that in 2012, 73.4% of all senior high schools in Japan were public schools. It was named "ratio" until 2020, when the variable was changed to "percentage", but they were calculated the same way.

- These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive view of the educational infrastructure across Japan. The number of institutions per population gives insight into the accessibility of education for different age groups, while the number per inhabitable area reflects the physical distribution of schools. The ratios/percentages of public institutions show the balance between public and private education provision. Together, these metrics can reveal regional differences in educational resources, urbanization patterns, and government priorities in education. They allow for comparisons between prefectures with different population sizes and geographical characteristics. Analyzing these metrics over time can also indicate trends in educational policy and infrastructure development across Japan, such as changes in school distribution or shifts in the balance between public and private education. This information is important for understanding the educational landscape and informing policy decisions related to educational access and resource allocation.

- These metrics provide insights into the gender balance among school teachers across different regions of Japan. They can reflect various factors such as societal norms, employment policies, and career preferences in different areas. Comparing the ratios between elementary and junior high/lower secondary school schools can reveal differences in gender distribution at different levels of education. The data over time allows for analysis of trends in gender representation in the teaching profession. These figures can be important indicators of gender equality in the education sector and may have implications for students' perceptions of gender roles in society.

- These metrics provide a multifaceted view of the education system in Japan, from early childhood through high school. The student-to-teacher and student-to-class ratios offer insights into the resources available to students and the potential quality of individual attention they might receive. The ratios of public institution attendance reflect the balance between public and private education in different regions, which can indicate both government priorities and societal preferences. Together, these metrics can reveal regional differences in educational resources, class sizes, and the structure of the education system. Comparing these metrics over time can also indicate trends in educational policy and practice across Japan, such as efforts to reduce class sizes or shifts in the balance between public and private education.

- The years covered are 1995, 2000-2019 for subsection 1.1 Elementary school educational expenses (per pupils)

- The years covered are 1995, 2000-2020 for subsections 1.2 Junior high school educational expenses and 1.3 High school educational expenses

- The years covered are 1995, 2000-2018, 2020 subsection 1.4 for Kindergarten educational expenses

- The years covered are 2015-2020 for subsection 1.5 Authorized child centers educational expenses

- The calculations are made by employing the formula: (Total educational expenses for the specific school type) / (Total number of students in that school type)

- For each prefecture and year, they would have: calculated the total educational expenses for each school type (elementary, junior high, high school, kindergarten, authorized child centers), counted the total number of students in each school type, then divided the total expenses by the number of students to get the per-pupil expenditure.

According to the data dictionary:
- For elementary schools (E8102), junior high schools (E8103), and high schools (E8104), the denominator is listed as "School education expenditure per student" for each respective school type.
- For kindergartens (E8101) and authorized child centers (E810101), the denominator is also listed as "School education expenditure per student" for each respective type.

- These metrics provide insights into the financial investment in education across different levels of schooling and across different prefectures in Japan. They allow for comparisons of educational spending between different types of schools and between different regions. The data over time enables analysis of trends in educational funding, which could reflect changes in educational policies, economic conditions, or demographic shifts. Higher per-pupil expenditures might indicate greater resources available for education, potentially leading to better facilities, smaller class sizes, or more comprehensive educational programs. However, it's important to consider these figures alongside other metrics, such as educational outcomes and regional economic factors, for a more complete understanding of the education system's efficiency and effectiveness.

- The inclusion of authorized child centers (Kindergarten-and-day-care center type) in this category reflects Japan's evolving early childhood education and care system, integrating traditional kindergartens with day-care services. This allows for analysis of resource allocation in these integrated facilities compared to traditional kindergartens and other school types.

- When interpreting these statistics, researchers and policymakers should be aware of potential differences in cost structures between urban and rural areas, variations in local funding models, and any changes in the definition or scope of educational expenses over time. Cross-referencing these expenditure figures with other educational and demographic data can provide a more comprehensive picture of the educational landscape across Japan.
